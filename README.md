# PAYE Modernisation Technical Overview
The objective of PAYE Modernisation is that Revenue, employers and employees will have the most accurate, up to date information relating to pay and tax deductions. This will ensure that the right tax deduction is made at the right time from the right employees, and that employers pay over the correct tax deduction and contribution for every employee. It will improve the accuracy, ease of understanding and transparency of the PAYE system for all stakeholders.

The reporting process by employers to Revenue will be fully integrated into the employer’s payroll run, thereby contributing to a significant streamlining of business processes and reducing administrative cost for employers.

All technical documentation, specifications, and examples for the following web services are accessible through the PAYE web services/Developers links.

These links provide specifications and support for future live functionality. It will enable payroll software developers to update their software packages to be compatible with PAYE reporting obligations from 2019 onwards.
